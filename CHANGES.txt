OperaDriver 0.4.2
=================

API changes
-----------

 * Removed preference paths from OperaDriverSettings.

New features
------------

 * New settings added to OperaDriverSettings:
   * Disable Opera Idle
   * Autostart setting to replace passing `null` into OperaDriver().
 * Always pass `-autotestmode` in to Opera. This will cause versions of Opera
   which do not support this flag to fail to start. Use a manual start instead.

Enhancements
------------

 * Increase page load timeout from 5 seconds to 60 seconds.
 * Merged desktop changes.
  * Disallow deletion of default main user profile.
  * Do not use pageload timeout for window events
 * Reduce level of Opera Idle logging output.
 * Correctly re-extract launchers when they have changed inside the JAR.
 * Buildfile updated to make testing and releasing easier.
   * Version number is obtained from `git describe`.
   * `test` target generates reports.
   * Individual tests can be run using -Dclass=com.opera.core.systems.<Class>
     where <Class> is one of the classes under test/.
   * Add launchers to jar in `jar` task, rather than executing `zip`.
     Compatibility with Windows.

   for launchers on Windows lingering.
