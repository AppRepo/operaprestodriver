====================================

API changes
-----------

 * Removed preference paths from OperaDriverSettings.

New features
------------

 * New settings added to OperaDriverSettings:

   * Version number is obtained from `git describe`.

   * Individual tests can be run using -Dclass=com.opera.core.systems.<Class>
     where <Class> is one of the classes under test/.
   * Add launchers to jar in `jar` task, rather than executing `zip`.
     Compatibility with Windows.
