OperaDriver is Opera's webdriver implementation.

OperaDriver can drive the browser running various tests on your web
pages, just as if a real user was navigating through them. It can
simulate actions like clicking links, entering text and submitting
forms, and reports results back to you so you know that your website
works as intended.

OperaDriver's end-user emulation ensures that your entire stack (HTML,
scripts, styling, embedded resources and backend setup) is functioning
correctly, and this without tedious manual testing routines.
